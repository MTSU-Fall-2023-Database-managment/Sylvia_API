# SYLVIA

We developed an application with the goal of pulling and analyzing stock data.

<hr>

In this project, we implement an API backend using .NET that works as a stand alone console application. As a reach goal we wanted to also implement an interactive frontend using React. 

## Building the API

To build the API open the `Sylvia_API.SLN` file in Visual Studio, ensure the CreateConn function is filled out properly and click CTRL+SFT+B to build the application. Visual Studio will tell you the path to where the API executable is saved.

## Building the UI

To build the UI open the Sylvia_UI folder in Visual Studio Code, Open a terminal, and run 'node .\index.js'
